The name of my project is UBRT2.0. The name does not stand for anything in particular, but is  just a random selection of letters. The purpose of the app is to allow users to keep track of jobsites and the companies they are attached to.  Thanks to omniauth a new user can take advantage of siging in securly through google to access the database of companies and their jobsites. The site is very easy to navigate through with all of its features labeled and in plain view. I believe that with much more development and a little bit of styling using css, this web-app can become a very useful tool for the person who needs orginization. This project was a bit challenging.  Rails, alothough a simplified version of sinatra, can be a bit confusing. The very subtle differences between Rails and the previous project can lead to common mistakes, such as routes, nested routes, and nested forms. Still the web-app was very much light weight compared to previous projects and worked very well.
