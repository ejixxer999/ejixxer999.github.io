The title of my CLI project is called IP_FoodFinder. The main goal of my gem is to gather users' locations and display a list of restaurants within a one mile radius. Using object oriented ruby, information was pulled from two APIs and then filtered through classes and methods to display only the important information needed, such as, resturant name, address, contact numbers, locations and afforability. During the creation of my CLI I have made a total of five classes, each responsible for hosting information on the user's input and data pulled. The first API used was responsible for gathering the location data of the user. This information was able to supply the current user's city and state, along with the timezone, date and current time. The second API is responsible for gathering the restaurant data within one mile of the user. The latitude and longitude being captured by the first API, made it possible to interpulate that information into the second API's pull request. Once the main information was completed, it was time to bring some life into the code. This was done by using styling gems such as 'colorize' and 'lolize', which added color to the text. ASCII images were used to make the animated loading screen, and pie image on the main menu. The styling gems and objects brings about a fun and exciting environment to my CLI. 

Please enjoy IP_FoodFinder!
