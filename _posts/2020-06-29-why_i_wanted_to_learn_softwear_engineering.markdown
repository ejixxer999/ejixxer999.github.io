All my life i have been surrounded by the newest and greatest tech. My father loved staying up to date with all things technology. At the very young age of 6 i was introduced to my first computer. I cant tell you what kind of computer it was but to show its age i will describe it. it was a very tiny computer maybe about the size of a modern day ipad, but it was as think as a science textbook. the screen was even smaller and it did not have many apps. the mouse was just a ball, not a track pad. As low tech as this computer was I fell in love with it . 

Because of this spontanous interaction with my first computer, my life has now been dedicaded to understanding them and trying to make something that can contribute to the world of tech. Going through highschool I was trying my best to teach myself how to code and it was hard. Luckly I came across FlatIron. I couldnt join just yet buy i knew once i finished highschool that was that route i was going to take. Finally im here writing this blog for an assignment in flatiron! The reason i want to learn softwear engineering is because i want to be able to help in the advancement of all things tech. I want love figuring out how things work on a computer and being able to make litterally anything. lastly I see softwear develope as a cure for the future. Every dieseas that is here today will eventually be solved with the help of computers, and it would be awesome to have the skills to help.
