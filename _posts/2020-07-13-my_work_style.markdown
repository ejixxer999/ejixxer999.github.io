During my coding journey, I have tried and failed many times at completing a lab in just one shot. Although I have yet to reach that goal I have learned alot about my coding style and worth ethic. I am the kind of person who will fail and try again multiple times. Coding has many twists and turns, and will throw curve balls like no tomorrow. The best was that i have discovered to deal with this problem is trial and error. Luckly for me we can use binding pry, which I abuse. 

Binding pry has helped me work out code issues in every lab. I have been able to speed up my code and make it as compact as possible while still keeping it clear and easy to read. As of right now this is the best method for completing a lab, and until I am a more experienced programmer this will be my method of choice.
